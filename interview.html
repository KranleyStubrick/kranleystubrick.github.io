    <h1>Peer Interview</h1>
    <h2>John Messer: Software Engineer at Datamaxx Group</h2>

    <a href="https://www.datamaxx.com/">https://www.datamaxx.com/</a>

    <p>My responsibilities include bugfixing, designing and implementing new features and pretty much everything that encompasses our flagship commercial software.</p>

    <p>I have worked at this company for a little over a year now.</p>

    <p>If your career is web developer it looks pretty good. If you want to do more software like what I'm working on, I would get some experience in C# or at least show it on your website portfolio. If your current objective is to just land an internship it looks pretty good.</p>

    <p >I would, however, personally upgrade the look of the website for my portfolio. I haven't experimented much with the GitHub portfolio too much but if you can get some nice animations using CSS HTML, it would make your web dev portfolio pop compared to others. I personally find it tedious to meticulously decide which font I will use or design some nice animations when it comes to front end development but I know from experience it can really help show how much you care about image which is beneficial in commercial settings. This is especially true when presenting something to the marketing department because if your company does have a marketing department they will critique your project's looks for the customer and expect you to know how to fix the look. My point is that having a little visual design/frontend development helps.</p>

    <p>Your career portfolio could definitely have some hard experience i.e. an internship or something of the sort within it. For a start it looks pretty good.</p>

    <p>Compared to my employees, who definitely don't have as much work in having a portfolio it looks good but my employees have the benefit of having 3-30+ years of experience as software engineers at various companies under their belt. So, they definitely have that on you but I can tell that having this portfolio will 100% give you an advantage on getting your foot in the door if you're looking for beginner jobs. Just don't go for the senior engineer jobs right off the bat.</p>

    <p >My suggestions to any young developer or really anyone trying to get a job is to go out of your way to get a professional photo taken. I see a surprising amount of bad pictures used that it would be very beneficial to get one. Also, work on getting some internship experience somewhere in the field you want to ultimately begin a career in. Another good tip that I'll reiterate is to upgrade the look of your portfolio that looks unique so that anyone glancing over it would immediately recognize it as memorable, professional, and clean. It always helps. Overall pretty good but the true test is to keep up with it and be persistent in your career on upgrading your resume and portfolio over the years.</p>
